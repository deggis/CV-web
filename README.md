# CV-web

This software provides browser interface for playing with CV package.
CV package contains Haskell wrappers for OpenCV and other tools for
computer vision.

## Inspiration

CV-web is inspired and currently also adapted from Chris Smith's
[gloss-web](https://github.com/cdsmith/gloss-web) that provides
browser interface for trying out Gloss tools in browser.

There's currently no test site for CV-web. Gloss-web can be tested here:

## Installation

Development is done using GHC 7.4.1. At least that works. :-)

 * Install CV using instructions found at http://aleator.github.com/CV/
 * cabal install (or cabal-dev install) should do the rest.

## Future

This is currently heavily work-in-progress with unknown future.
